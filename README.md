# Emopreter
An "Interpreter" for a programming language that consists of emojis and must be written in Comic Sans MS
# How to use it
First, you need to have python installed. You can then run one of the provided .odt files, by typing
```bash
python emopreter.py [NAME_OF_ODT_FILE]
```
# What it does
The python script extracts the content.xml file from the .odt file, looks if it's written in Comic Sans MS, and if so, it translates the emojis into python code and runs that.
You can see what emoji corresponds to what python code in the documentary, or by looking at the python script and understanding it.
